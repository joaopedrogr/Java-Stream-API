# Java Stream API

## üìò Description
The Java-Stream-API repository explores Java's Stream API, enabling efficient data collection manipulation in a functional way. This repository is ideal for developers looking to deepen their knowledge of Streams through practical examples and challenges.

Key Topics Covered:

- Creating Streams: How to initialize and work with data streams.
- Filtering and Transformations: Using filter, map, and reduce.
- Reduction and Aggregation: Working with reduce, min, max, and collect.
- Match and Other Operators: Using allMatch, anyMatch, noneMatch.
- Practical Challenges: Exercises to reinforce learned concepts.
